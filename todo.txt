VERY URGENT:
- nothing

URGENT:
- parallelize partial trace using e.g. .map() - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13068760/parallelise-python-loop-with-numpy-arrays-and-shared-memory

High priority:
- clean up the mess
- comment code
- work out documentation
- add complete state save after every 10% progress option for security reasons and eventual later review of data
-> possibly also save the occupation number operators in sparse format, partial trace array and even basis dictionary!
--> possibly add the option to load this stuff in, since it would SIGNIFICANTLY reduce the setup time for large system calculations
--> also possibly add the option to load a hamiltonian in sparse format in... check if this is even sensible in sense of memory usage
- add loading of 

Medium priority:
- clarify codewords in the config file
- check out if green function stuff can be improved even further
- improve

Low priority:
- add possibility of efficiently calculating different com time green functions
- include spectral and keldysh green function evaluation in the class methods
- add automatic backup option for long time work on clusters
